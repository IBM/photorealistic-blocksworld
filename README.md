# Photo-Realistic Blocksworld [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/IBM/photorealistic-blocksworld.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/IBM/photorealistic-blocksworld)

NEWS: `.npz` binaries are available from https://github.com/IBM/photorealistic-blocksworld/releases .

NEWS: Now works on blender 2.80+

NEWS: Random state generation (each state is randomized). Previously, a state is randomized at the beginning, but all states
have the same objects (colors, shapes). Also, this version does not assume placing objects on a certain grid.

This is a repository modified from the [CLEVR dataset](https://github.com/facebookresearch/clevr-dataset-gen)
for generating realistic visualizations of [blocksworld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blocks_world).


Setup:

With anaconda,

```
sudo apt-get install parallel jq
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate prb
```

Install blender:

```
wget https://download.blender.org/release/Blender2.77/blender-2.77a-linux-glibc211-x86_64.tar.bz2
tar xf blender-2.77a-linux-glibc211-x86_64.tar.bz2
echo $PWD > $(echo blender*/2.*/python/lib/python*/site-packages/)clevr.pth
```

Example: Run `./test.sh`.

For the original readme, see [README-clevr.md](README-clevr.md) .

Note: I changed all keyword options from using underscores to using hyphens (e.g. `--use_gpu` -> `--use-gpu`).

# Functionality

+ `render_images.py` : 
  
  Renders all possible states of the blocks world and dump the metadata
  (e.g. bounding boxes) in the corresponding json files.
  This file runs under the python distribution included in the blender.

+ `extract_region.py` :

  Extract each region that contains an object from an image and store them in
  png files. Takes a metadata json file as the input.
  This file runs in the conda environment.

+ `extract_all_regions_binary.py` :

  Extract the regions from the every images generated, resize them to 32x32 and
  store them in a `.npz` container along with the bounding box vector (x1,y1,x2,y2).
  This file runs in the conda environment.

+ `generate_all.sh` :

  Orchestrate several scripts to generate the whole dataset.

+ `merge-npz.py` :
  
  Each run of `generate_all` will enumerate the entire states/transtions of a
  particular blocksworld configuration.
  You can generate several environments, each of which has the different block shape, color etc.
  This script takes several result npz files of such runs and concatenate them into a single file.

# Data format

The npz files generated by `extract_all_regions_binary.py` can be loaded into
numpy as follows and contains the following fields:


``` python
import numpy as np
with np.load("path/to/blocks-3-3.npz") as data:
    images      = data["images"]      # uint8 array of shape [state_id, object_id, patch_size, patch_size].
                                      # it contains the image patch for each object in the environment.
                                      # patch_size is 32 by default.

    bboxes      = data["bboxes"]      # uint16 array of shape [state_id, object_id, 4].
                                      # it contains the bounding box of each image patch in [x1,y1,x2,y2] format.

    transitions = data["transitions"] # uint32 array of shape [transition id, 2]. 
                                      # each transition contains two indices to `images`, 
                                      # which represents the source and the destination state of the transition.

    picsize     = data["picsize"]     # an int vector of 2 elements, [maxY,maxX], containing the original image size.

```

# Running

To generate a dataset of 200 transitions with 3 blocks:

    ./generate_all.sh 3 200

To generate a large dataset with 5 blocks / 3 stacks (>80k states=images),
running it on a single computer would take a lot of time.
If you have access to a compute cluster, you can distribute the workload
to the job scheduler.
You should customize the job submission command in `generate_all.sh` for your job scheduler.
Once you get done, run

    ./generate_all.sh 5 1000 true 5

Further customization details are available in the comment section of the script.
